# Chromedriver-challenge

This is the assignment for Module 11, which includes two code files. 

The code files for Part 1 and Part 2 correspond to two different projects. Please ensure that your chromedriver is downloaded and that you have set the PATH to its directory in the .bashrc or .bash_profile file before running the code. To set your chromedriver path:

**export PATH=$PATH:/path/to/chromedriver_directory**

Please make sure you have the necessary setup and driver in place before running the code.
